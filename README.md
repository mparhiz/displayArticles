This project is a small sample of showing articles as a list of cards.
This project is based on React (v17.0.1) using react-bootstrap (v1.4.0) and SCSS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run stylelint`

Runs the stylelint to check all scss files as pre set rules in the `.stylelintrc.json`  

## Live Application
